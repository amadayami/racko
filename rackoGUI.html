			<h1>How to Play <span id="modal-title">Racko</span></h1>
			<h2>Object</h2>
			<p>
				The first player to score 500 points wins!
				You win a hand by arranging your cards from low to high
				and getting a Racko!
			</p>
			<h2>Set-Up</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p class="inner-p">MODE: Choose between standard and double Racko.</p>
					<p class="inner-p">Standard Racko is played with 60 cards (1-60) in a
					deck and 10 cards in a player's hand.</p>
					<p class="inner-p">Double Racko is played with 120 cards (1-120) in a
					deck and 20 cards in a player's hand.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="inner-p">PLAYERS: Choose the number of players (4 players max).
					You can also choose to play against computer players!</p>
					<p class="inner-p">Note: You must play with at least one human.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Gameplay</h2>
			<p>
				<p class="inner-p">ON YOUR TURN: You pick one card, the top of either the draw
				or the discard pile, and place it in your rack.</p>
				<p class="inner-p">If you take from the DISCARD pile, you must replace a card
				from your rack with the card you drew. The card you replace
				is then placed on the top of the discard pile.</p>
				<p class="inner-p">If you take from the DRAW pile, you can either replace a card
				from your rack with the card you drew, or place in on the top
				of the discard pile.</p>
				<p class="inner-p">Gameplay continues with players alternating turns until one
				player gets a Racko. The player who gets Racko receives 75
				points and all other players receive 5 points for each card
				they have in ascending order from the bottom.</p>
			</p>
			<h2>Winning the Game</h2>
			<p>
				Continue playing rounds until a player scores 500 points.
				Note: If two players score more than 500 points, then the
				highest total wins!
