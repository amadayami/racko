# Digital Racko
## What is Racko?
[Racko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack-O) is a game released by Milton Bradley in 1956. The objective of the game is to have your hand of 10 cards in ascending numerical order while playing with a deck of cards numbered 1-60. Each successful hand is worth 75 points and the game is won when a player has 500 points total.

## How do I play?
To play, take the contents of the racko.js file and enter it into the web developer console. Then, enter `game()` into the console and a series of prompts setting up the game will
appear. (I am working on GUI so it is easier to play!)

## Modifications from the original gameplay
- In the original version of the game, the number of cards you play with depends on how many players are playing (ex. 2 -> 40, 3 -> 50, 4 -> 60). In this version, you play with either 60 or 120 cards depending on which type of game you want to play and this is independent of number of players.
- If you play with 120 cards, you also play with 20 cards in your hand.
- In the original, there is also a rule that players must have at least 3 sequential cards to win a hand, but that is not included in this version.
