# Digital Racko
## What is Racko?
[Racko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack-O) is a game released by Milton Bradley in 1956. The objective of the game is to have your hand of 10 cards in ascending numerical order.
Each successful hand is worth 75 points and the game is won when a player has 500 points total.

## How do I play?
To play, take the contents of the racko.js file and enter it into the web developer console. Then, enter `game()` into the console and a series of prompts setting up the game will
appear. (I am working on GUI so it is easier to play!)
