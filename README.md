# Digital Racko
## What is Racko?
[Racko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack-O) is a game released by Milton Bradley in 1956. The objective of the game is to have your hand of 10 cards in ascending numerical order while playing with a deck of cards numbered 1-60. Each successful hand is worth 75 points and the game is won when a player has 500 points total.

## How do I play?
### Developer Console Version
Run the contents of racko.js in the web developer console. Then, enter `game()` and play using the prompt to give input.

### GUI Version
Click the new game button and choose the game mode, number of players, their names, and if they are a computer player. On your turn, click a card in your hand, and then the 'Switch
Cards' button to exchange the top card with the selected card. If you want a new card, click the draw pile card (the red box next to the discard pile). To end your turn early,
click the 'End Turn' button. For more information about gameplay, click the 'Rulebook' button.

## Modifications from the original gameplay
- In the original version of the game, the number of cards you play with depends on how many players are playing (ex. 2 -> 40, 3 -> 50, 4 -> 60). In this version, you play with either 60 or 120 cards depending on which type of game you want to play and this is independent of number of players.
- If you play with 120 cards, you also play with 20 cards in your hand.
- In the original, there is also a rule that players must have at least 3 sequential cards to win a hand, but that is not included in this version.
